### hello world ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Jose Guaro**, and I studied **_Mathematics and Computer Science_** at **UC San Diego** _(Class of 2021)_

#### Interests :satellite: :  
* **_Programming Languages:_** Most of my work and interests in PL lie in runtime systems and management, mainly experimenting with new venues for computational resources.
